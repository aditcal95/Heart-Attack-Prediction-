# Heart-Attack-Prediction- I've developed a program to leverage scikit learn and the data on heart patients and their vitals
to predict further cases of heart attacks.

The code generates a prompt screen that will ask for the vitals of the new patient,
compare it to the training model data and then predict the possibility of the occurance of a heart attack.

1. Download both csv files, 1 & 2.
2. Place the code and the csv files in your desired root file and make sure all dependencies are satisfied.
3. Run the code to generate the prompt and enter vitals of the patient to see the prediction.
